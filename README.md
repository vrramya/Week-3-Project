# Getting and Cleaning Data: Week 3 Course Project

etc.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the reshape2 R package
### download_data.R

```RunAnalysis()``` calls ```DownloadData()```, contained in the file
```download_data.R```. ```DownloadData()``` checks to see if the original
data has already been downloaded, and if not, downloads the ZIP file to
```./HAR Dataset.zip```, and unzips it to ```./UCI HAR Dataset```.


### merge_data.R

After downloading the data, ```RunAnalysis()``` calls ```MergeData()```,
which is contained in ```merge_data.R```, along with several helper
functions.

```MergeData()``` makes the following calls:

1. ```ReadFeatures()```: This grabs the features from
   ```./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt``` and reads them into a list.
2. ```ReadLabels()```: This grabs the activity labels from
   ```./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt``` and reads them into a
   data frame, naming the columns ```label``` and ```activity```.
3. ```ReadDataset()```: This is called first with the test dataset, then
   with the train dataset. It takes the X file, containing the sensor
   readings, the y file, containing the activity label for each observation,
   the subject file, containing the subject identifiers for each observation,
   the features list from step 1, and the labels table from step 2. It reads
   the X file, y file and subject file into data frames. Next, it sets the
   names of the X dataset to the features list, then appends the y file column,
   and the subject file column to the end. It then merges with the labels data
   frame based on the activity id, which adds the human-readable activity label
   to the dataset.
4. ```TidyNames()```: ```ReadDataset()``` passes the resulting dataset, selecting
   only the columns containing ```mean``` and ```std``` features, along with the
   activity label and the subject, into ```TidyNames()```, which normalizes the
   dataset names to be downcased, and to remove all non-alphanumeric characters.
   e.g. ```tBodyAcc-mean()-X``` becomes ```tbodyaccmeanx```.
5. Finally, ```MergeData()``` binds the test and train dataset rows together
   and returns the complete, combined dataset.

### run_analysis.R


```run_analysis.R``` is the main point of entry. It sources all other
files in the project, defines the main ```RunAnalysis()``` function, and
then calls the ```RunAnalysis()``` function.



### average_data.R

After merging the data, ```RunAnalysis()``` passes the resulting dataset to
```AverageData()```, contained in ```average_data.R```. ```AverageData()```
uses the ```reshape2``` package to ```melt``` the dataset based on ```subject```
and ```activity```, and then ```dcast``` it together based on those two fields,
providing the mean. The final result is a data frame containing the means of each
of the included features for each combination of subject and activity.

## Output

The final result is output in CSV format to ```./averages.txt```.
