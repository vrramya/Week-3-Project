## Original Data

The original data for this project comes from the UCI Human
Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, which contains
a set of smartphone sensor readings associated with various
activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs,
etc. Details of the study can be found
[here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The data were downloaded on May 25th at approximately 3:45 PM MDT to create
the ```averages.txt``` file contained in this repo.

## Variables

Per the [project instructions](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-003/human_grading/view/courses/972136/assessments/3/submissions),
